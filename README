**PLEASE ALSO READ THE WARNING FILE THAT**
      **COMES WITH THIS PROGRAM.**

  Description - num-utils are a set of utilities that aim to provide 
 the numeric equivalent of the GNU text-utils.  These programs do
 operations on numbers such as filtering, adding, averaging and so on.
 They help expand and complete the shell vocabulary.

  Right now these programs are in the beta stage.  If you have any bug
 fixes or suggestions to improve this program, please see the "Contact"
 section of this document .  An extensive list of planned features is
 in the 'GOALS' file included with this program.

  Installation
  ------------

  For now please use the Makefile to install the programs.  By default
 this will install them in /usr/bin.   Standard 'make' and 'make install'
 commands will build and install the programs.  You can also make an RPM
 source and binary package from the Makefile using 'make rpm'.

  How to use
  ----------

  These programs are useful when you want to deal with numbers on STDIN or
  from files.  There are different programs for different functions:

   numsum - Adding a set of numbers from STDIN is simply a matter of passing
           just the numbers themselves to numsum.

        $ cat test/numbers | numsum
        21937.74
        $

    You can use other programs like numgrep, awk or sed to get just the numbers
   that you want from a file:

        $ cat access_log | awk {'print $10'} | numsum

   numgrep - Similar to grep, but specific to numbers.  This program will let
             you search for ranges of numbers and sequences.

        $ numgrep /-5..5,100..200/ tests/numbers
        5
        135
        135
        1
        1.5
        4.5351
        3
        3
        -1
        -2.543
        -1
        3

   random - Generates random numbers based on range expressions.

        $ random /0..100/
        47
        $

   range -  This program will spit out a sequence of numbers for use in stuff
           like shell for loops.  The syntax for this program will most likely
           change in the next version.

        $ range /5..10/
        5 6 7 8 9 10
        $
        
        $ for i in `range /1..5,10..15/` ; do mv track$i.mp3 song$i.mp3 ; done

        12
        13
        14
        15
        $

   interval - This program will calculate and display the interval between
   every two sequential numbers on the input stream:

       $ cat numbers
       1
       2
       3
       5
       10
       45
       35
       2
       1
       $ cat numbers | interval
       1
       1
       2
       5
       35
       -10
       -33
       -1
       $
